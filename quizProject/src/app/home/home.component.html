        questions.

        Keep your team discussions to a low roar unless you want the neighboring team to eavesdrop, or
        alternatively, discuss loudly an incorrect answer and hope they WILL be eavesdropping. Anything goes.
        Team taunting is definitely allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Judges are allowed</strong> to sample any food or beverage on any table they so chooses and it should be
